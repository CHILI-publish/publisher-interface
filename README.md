# Publisher Interface Wiki
This branch contains source files related to the wiki documentation for [Publisher Interface](https://github.com/chili-publish/publisher-interface).

The project is broken up into two directories:
- 📁 src - the source files for the wiki documentation.
- 📁 build - the build scripts for building the autogenerated portions of the wiki documentation.

After building the script you will have a third folder called 📁 wiki, which contains the content that will be pushed to the github page.

# Building The Wiki
