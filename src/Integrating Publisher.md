# Integrating Publisher
An editor that is embedded in your HTML pages can be interacted with using our JavaScript API. 

There are many reasons a team would want use the JavaScript API. Some examples are:

- Updating variables on document load
- Connecting to a custom widget
- Building a partial or complete custom interface
- Creating a ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button or an auto-save feature

Whatever you reasons, integrating with Publisher is rather easy, and this guide will help you go from nothing to working integration.
